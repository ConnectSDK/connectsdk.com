WebAppSession
=============

Overview
--------

When a web app is launched on a first screen device, there are certain
tasks that can be performed with that web app. WebAppSession serves as a
second screen reference of the web app that was launched. It behaves
similarly to LaunchSession, but is not nearly as static.

In Depth
--------

On top of maintaining session information (contained in the
launchSession property), WebAppSession provides access to a number of
capabilities.

-  MediaPlayer

-  MediaControl

-  Bi-directional communication with web app

MediaPlayer and MediaControl are provided to allow for the most common
first screen use cases a media player (audio, video, & images).

The Connect SDK JavaScript Bridge has been produced to provide
normalized support for these capabilities across protocols (Chromecast,
webOS, etc).

Properties
----------

`LaunchSession </apis/1-6-0/ios/LaunchSession>`__ \* launchSession
   LaunchSession object containing key session information. Much of this
   information is required for web app messaging & closing the web app.

`DeviceService </apis/1-6-0/ios/DeviceService>`__ \* service
   DeviceService that was responsible for launching this web app.

id<`WebAppSessionDelegate </apis/1-6-0/ios/WebAppSessionDelegate>`__> delegate
   When messages are received from a web app, they are parsed into the
   appropriate object type (string vs JSON/NSDictionary) and routed to
   the WebAppSessionDelegate.
