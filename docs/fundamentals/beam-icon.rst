Beam Icon
==========
Connect SDK is about delivering a multi-device experience across multiple
platforms. Our goal from the beginning was to solve a fragmentation problem.
Therefore, instead of creating another "beam" icon and expecting users to learn
one more visual artifact - we recommend you use one of the many great icons
already available. Google's Cast icon is becoming widely recognized
for this use case, so consider using it.
Please make sure you comply with any rules set forth by the icon creator.
