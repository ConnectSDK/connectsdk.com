Testing & Debugging
=====================
Due to the abstracted nature of Connect SDK, it may not be necessary for you to
have a suite of test devices. For many use cases, testing on one supported
platform can be sufficient.

However, depending on your application and use case, it may be advisable to test
each platform before you release your application. For example, while video
beaming is abstracted, each platform supports different video protocols and you
should make sure that your specific app's video content is playable on your
desired platform.

webOS
-------
The webOS TV emulator is currently available through the LG developer portal,
`download here`_.

.. _download here: http://webostv.developer.lge.com/sdk/installation/

This will limit your testing on the emulator to web app & media support.

for the Emulator to be discoverable.
