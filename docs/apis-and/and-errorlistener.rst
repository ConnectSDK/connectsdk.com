ErrorListener
=============
``com.connectsdk.service.capability.listeners.ErrorListener``

Generic asynchronous operation response error handler block. In all
cases, you will get a valid ServiceCommandError object. Connect SDK will
make all attempts to give you the lowest-level error possible. In cases
where an error is generated by Connect SDK, an enumerated error code
(ConnectStatusCode) will be present on the ServiceCommandError object.

Low-level error example
-----------------------

**Situation**

Connect SDK receives invalid XML from a device, generating a parsing
error

**Result**

Connect SDK will call the ErrorListener and pass off the
ServiceCommandError generated during parsing of the XML.

High-level error example
------------------------

**Situation**

An invalid value is passed to a device capability method

**Result**

The capability method will immediately invoke the ErrorListener and pass
off an ServiceCommandError object with a status code of
ConnectStatusCodeArgumentError.

-  error

    ServiceCommandError object describing the nature of the problem.
    Error descriptions are not localized and mostly intended for
    developer use. It is not recommended to display most error
    descriptions in UI elements.

Methods

    Method to return the error that was generated. Will pass an error
    object with a helpful status code and error message.
