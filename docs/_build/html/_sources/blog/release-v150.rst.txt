With ConnectSDK version 1.5, we’re extremely proud to announce support
for Amazon’s Fling SDK on Fire TV and Fire Stick devices! iOS and
Android Apps can now seamlessly beam video, audio, and images to Fire
TV / Fire Stick. We are looking forward to expanding support for
Amazon products.
To further integrate apps within Smart TVs, we now have ability to pin
web apps on webOS 2014+ TVs. Developers can now provide convenient,
instant access to a wealth of web apps like MusixMatch. If you have a
web app to offer and want to increase your install base with minimal
effort, please register `here`_.
