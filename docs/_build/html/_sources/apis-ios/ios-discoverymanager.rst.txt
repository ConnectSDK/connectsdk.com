DiscoveryManager
================

Overview
--------

At the heart of Connect SDK is DiscoveryManager, a multi-protocol
service discovery engine with a pluggable architecture. Much of your
initial experience with Connect SDK will be with the DiscoveryManager
class, as it consolidates discovered service information into
ConnectableDevice objects.

In depth
--------

DiscoveryManager supports discovering services of differing protocols by
using DiscoveryProviders. Many services are discoverable over
`SSDP <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cai-ssdp-v1-03>`__ and are
registered to be discovered with the SSDPDiscoveryProvider class.

As services are discovered on the network, the DiscoveryProviders will
notify DiscoveryManager. DiscoveryManager is capable of attributing
multiple services, if applicable, to a single ConnectableDevice
instance. Thus, it is possible to have a mixed-mode ConnectableDevice
object that is theoretically capable of more functionality than a single
service can provide.

DiscoveryManager keeps a running list of all discovered devices and
maintains a filtered list of devices that have satisfied any of your
CapabilityFilters. This filtered list is used by the DevicePicker when
presenting the user with a list of devices.

Only one instance of the DiscoveryManager should be in memory at a time.
To assist with this, DiscoveryManager has singleton accessors at
sharedManager and sharedManagerWithDeviceStore:.

Example:

.. code-block:: objc

   DiscoveryManager *discoveryManager = [DiscoveryManager sharedManager];
   discoveryManager.delegate = self; // set delegate to listen for discovery events
   [discoveryManager startDiscovery];

Properties
----------

id<:doc:`DiscoveryManagerDelegate <ios-discoverymanagerdelegate>`> delegate
   Delegate which should receive discovery updates. It is not necessary
   to set this delegate property unless you are implementing your own
   device picker. Connect SDK provides a default DevicePicker which acts
   as a DiscoveryManagerDelegate, and should work for most cases.

   If you have provided a capabilityFilters array, the delegate will
   only receive update messages for ConnectableDevices which satisfy at
   least one of the CapabilityFilters. If no capabilityFilters array is
   provided, the delegate will receive update messages for all
   ConnectableDevice objects that are discovered.

NSArray \* capabilityFilters
   A ConnectableDevice will be displayed in the DevicePicker and
   compatibleDevices array if it matches any of the CapabilityFilter
   objects in this array.

:doc:`DeviceServicePairingLevel <ios-deviceservicepairinglevel>` pairingLevel
   The pairingLevel property determines whether capabilities that
   require pairing (such as entering a PIN) will be available.

   If pairingLevel is set to DeviceServicePairingLevelOn,
   ConnectableDevices that require pairing will prompt the user to pair
   when connecting to the ConnectableDevice.

   If pairingLevel is set to DeviceServicePairingLevelOff (the default),
   connecting to the device will avoid requiring pairing if possible but
   some capabilities may not be available.

id<:doc:`ConnectableDeviceStore <ios-connectabledevicestore>`> deviceStore
   ConnectableDeviceStore object which loads & stores references to all
   discovered devices. Pairing codes/keys, SSL certificates, recent
   access times, etc are kept in the device store.

   ConnectableDeviceStore is a protocol which may be implemented as
   needed. A default implementation, DefaultConnectableDeviceStore,
   exists for convenience and will be used if no other device store is
   provided.

   In order to satisfy user privacy concerns, you should provide a UI
   element in your app which exposes the ConnectableDeviceStore
   removeAll method.

   To disable the ConnectableDeviceStore capabilities of Connect SDK,
   set this value to nil. This may be done at the time of instantiation
   with ``[DiscoveryManager sharedManagerWithDeviceStore:nil]``.

BOOL useDeviceStore
   Whether pairing state will be automatically loaded/saved in the
   deviceStore. This property is not available for direct modification.
   To disable the device store,

Methods
-------

\+ (instancetype) **sharedManager**
   Singleton accessor for DiscoveryManager. This method calls
   sharedManagerWithDeviceStore: and passes an instance of
   DefaultConnectableDeviceStore.

\+ (instancetype) **sharedManagerWithDeviceStore**:(id<:doc:`ConnectableDeviceStore <ios-connectabledevicestore>`>)\ *deviceStore*
   Singleton accessor for DiscoveryManager, will initialize singleton
   with reference to a custom ConnectableDeviceStore object.

   **Parameters:**

   * deviceStore â€“ (optional) An object which implements the ConnectableDeviceStore protocol to be used for save/load of device information. You may provide nil to completely disable the device store capabilities of the SDK.

\- (NSDictionary \*) **compatibleDevices**
   Filtered list of discovered ConnectableDevices, limited to devices
   that match at least one of the CapabilityFilters in the
   capabilityFilters array. Each ConnectableDevice object is keyed
   against its current IP address.

\- (NSDictionary \*) **allDevices**
   List of all devices discovered by DiscoveryManager. Each
   ConnectableDevice object is keyed against its current IP address.

\- (void) **startDiscovery**
   Start scanning for devices on the local network.

\- (void) **stopDiscovery**
   Stop scanning for devices.

   This method will be called when your app enters a background state.
   When your app resumes, startDiscovery will be called.

\- (:doc:`DevicePicker <ios-devicepicker>` \*) **devicePicker**
   Get a DevicePicker to show compatible ConnectableDevices that have
   been found by DiscoveryManager.

   **Returns:** DevicePickerDevicePicker singleton for use in picking devices
