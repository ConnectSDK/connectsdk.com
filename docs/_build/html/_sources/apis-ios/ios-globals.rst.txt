GCDWebServerAsyncStreamBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

void(^)(GCDWebServerBodyReaderCompletionBlock completionBlock)

The GCDWebServerAsyncStreamBlock works like the GCDWebServerStreamBlock
except the streamed data can be returned at a later time allowing for
truly asynchronous generation of the data.

The block must call "completionBlock" passing the new chunk of data when
ready, an empty NSData when done, or nil on error and pass a NSError.

The block cannot call "completionBlock" more than once per invocation.

GCDWebServerBodyReaderCompletionBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

void(^)(NSData \*data, NSError \*error)

The GCDWebServerBodyReaderCompletionBlock is passed by GCDWebServer to
the GCDWebServerBodyReader object when reading data from it
asynchronously.

GCDWebServerMatchBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

)(NSString \*requestMethod, NSURL \*requestURL, NSDictionary
\*requestHeaders, NSString \*urlPath, NSDictionary \*urlQuery)

The GCDWebServerMatchBlock is called for every handler added to the
GCDWebServer whenever a new HTTP request has started (i.e. HTTP headers
have been received). The block is passed the basic info for the request
(HTTP method, URL, headers...) and must decide if it wants to handle it
or not.

If the handler can handle the request, the block must return a new
GCDWebServerRequest instance created with the same basic info.
Otherwise, it simply returns nil.

GCDWebServerCompletionBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

void(^)(GCDWebServerResponse \*response)

The GCDWebServerAsynchronousProcessBlock works like the
GCDWebServerProcessBlock except the GCDWebServerResponse can be returned
to the server at a later time allowing for asynchronous generation of
the response.

The block must eventually call "completionBlock" passing a
GCDWebServerResponse or nil on error, which will result in a 500 HTTP
status code returned to the client. It's however recommended to return a
GCDWebServerErrorResponse on error so more useful information can be
returned to the client.

GCDWebServerProcessBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

)(GCDWebServerRequest \*request)

The GCDWebServerProcessBlock is called after the HTTP request has been
fully received (i.e. the entire HTTP body has been read). The block is
passed the GCDWebServerRequest created at the previous step by the
GCDWebServerMatchBlock.

The block must return a GCDWebServerResponse or nil on error, which will
result in a 500 HTTP status code returned to the client. It's however
recommended to return a GCDWebServerErrorResponse on error so more
useful information can be returned to the client.

GCDWebServerStreamBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NSData \*(^)(NSError \**error)

The GCDWebServerStreamBlock is called to stream the data for the HTTP
body. The block must return either a chunk of data, an empty NSData when
done, or nil on error and set the "error" argument which is guaranteed
to be non-NULL.

FailureBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~

void(^)(NSError \*error)

Generic asynchronous operation response error handler block. In all
cases, you will get a valid NSError object. Connect SDK will make all
attempts to give you the lowest-level error possible. In cases where an
error is generated by Connect SDK, an enumerated error code
(ConnectStatusCode) will be present on the NSError object.

Low-level error example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Situation**

Connect SDK receives invalid XML from a device, generating a parsing error

**Result**

Connect SDK will call the FailureBlock and pass off the NSError generated during parsing of the XML.

High-level error example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Situation**

An invalid value is passed to a device capability method

**Result**

The capability method will immediately invoke the FailureBlock and pass
off an NSError object with a status code of
ConnectStatusCodeArgumentError.

* error

   NSError object describing the nature of the problem. Error
   descriptions are not localized and mostly intended for developer use.
   It is not recommended to display most error descriptions in UI
   elements.

SuccessBlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~

void(^)(id responseObject)

Generic asynchronous operation response success handler block. If there
is any response data to be processed, it will be provided via the
responseObject parameter.

* responseObject

   Contains the output data as a generic object reference. This value
   may be any of a number of types (NSString, NSDictionary, NSArray,
   etc). It is also possible that responseObject will be nil for
   operations that don't require data to be returned (move mouse, send
   key code, etc).
