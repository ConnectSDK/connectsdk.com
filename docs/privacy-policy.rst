   We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1)
   Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non-Personally
   Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.

   (1) Personally Identifiable Information

     -  We may collect your first and last name and product or service
        details if you contact us with a question related to our products
        or services;
     -  We may collect your first and last name, mailing address and
        billing information if you purchase a product or service on the
        Sites;

     ZENITH to collect your personally identifiable information, please do
     not provide it to us.

   (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

     "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical
     information or it can be demographic information, such as your age,
     location, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable
     information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples
     of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via
     the Sites:

     - Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that
       lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data
       -- such as the webpages you view.
     - Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect
       information about your activity on the Sites. For example, when
       someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the
       user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user
       has visited the Sites previously. You may set most browsers to notify
       you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with
       your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of
       the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites. Some
       of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While
       they are harmless, they may contain non-personally identifiable
       information and depending on your browser these cookies may not
       normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your
       browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how
       they may be deleted.
     - Product Information â€“ we may collect registration information or
       other details about your product or service. Unless this information
       is tied to your name or address, it is not considered personally
       identifiable.

     We collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all
     visitors to our Sites. If you do not want ZENITH to have access to
     this information, please do not visit our Sites.

3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information

   (1) Personally Identifiable Information

     We may share or disclose your personally identifiable information
     in the following instances:

     (i) To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you purchase or
     download an item from a site, we may share your personally identifiable
     information in order to provide the item to you. In addition, if you
     email us a question, we may use your email address to process your
     request and respond to your question. In addition, if you purchase
     a product via the Sites, we may need to share your data with third
     parties in order to have that product delivered to you and installed
     as you requested. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest,
     we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill
     the terms of that promotion.

     (ii) To our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates in order to
     better serve you. ZENITH may have to share your data with these
     parties in order to provide you with services that have been requested
     by you, or so that we can ensure our services and products are meeting
     your needs. For example, in some instances ZENITH may be required to
     transfer your data to our parent company in Korea in order to provide
     you with a product or service requested by you.

     (iii) To strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other
     unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we
     believe may be of interest to you. These parties may use your personally
     identifiable information to contact you with an offer or advertisement
     related to a product or service. If you do not want us to share your
     personally identifiable information in this manner, please do not
     provide us with this information.

     (iv) To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or
     independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide
     other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to,
     order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service,
     maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications
     on ZENITH's behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and
     prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions).
     We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not
     use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose
     than to provide the administrative services for which they are
     responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers
     that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personally
     identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated
     third-party service providers to have access to your information,
     please do not register or submit any personally identifiable
     information to us.

     (v) To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on
     the Sites, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing
     address and other information related to such purchase, and we may
     use such collected information in order to fulfill your purchase.
     We may also provide such information, or other personally identifiable
     information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as
     necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your
     credit card).

     (vi) To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such
     action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of
     law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend
     our rights or property, including the rights and property of ZENITH
     or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
     our end users.

     (vii) To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization
     process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions,
     and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

     (viii) To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage
     and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers
     and provide such information to third parties.

     (ix) To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third
     parties the information collected from these Sites. In the course
     of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information
     about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card
     or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card
     authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card
     information and address matches the information that you supplied
     to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.

     Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we
     request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise
     disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.

   (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

     Sites in the manner disclosed above, in the Section A (2). We may

  services via email or text message. For example, we may use your
  email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of
  payments, to send you information about changes to our products and
  services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by
  law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but
  they will be primarily informational in nature rather than
  promotional.
